Mason Prosser
Lucas Unruh
Christopher Syers
Tim Chang

1b. Write down your top three choices for open-source software 
projects to work on. Each can be one of the pre-built projects or 
something else; in the latter case, provide a short paragraph 
explaining your choice. 

1. Notepad++ - notepads and other text editors are things that are 
very familiar to all computer users. Notepad++ is written in C++, 
which is ideal for this project. Also, its features would be things 
that would make sense, like the menu bars, text screen, line numbers 
etc. This would make working with this project easy to get started. 

2. tesseract - tesseract is an OCR tool. OCR stands for optical  
character recognition, and it converts images of characters into 
digital characters. I am particularly interested in this because 
over the summer I worked with eggPlant, an automated testing tool 
than has a build-in OCR system. Also, I think it would be interesting 
to discover the sort of data structures the program uses to be able 
to recognizie multiple languages and characters. 
 
3. FLAC - FLAC is a free lossless audio codec. I think this would 
be interesting to work on, because I am very into music, and have 
always listened to MP3s. Although the market may be small, I think 
there is a place in the world for lossless audio. I think it would 
be interesting to discover a compression algorithm works, especially 
one that is so complicated and lossless.
