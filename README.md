This document will walk you through the process of:

1. Setting up a [Bitbucket] account if you do not already have one or
   associating your [Notre Dame] email address with your [Bitbucket] account.

2. Fork this repository to create a private copy.

3. Configuring the privacy and access controls of the forked repository.

[Bitbucket]:	https://bitbucket.org
[Notre Dame]:	http://www.nd.edu
[unlimited academic plan]:  https://bitbucket.org/account/user/pbui/plans/

1. Account Setup
================

1. First, open up your webrowser and go to http://bitbucket.org/, and click on
   the **Get started** on the upper right-hand corner:

    ![Bitbucket - Get started](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_get_started.png)

2. Next, you are to fill out the **Sign up** form with your information.  You
   can use any `username` and `password`, but we recommend that your `username`
   be your `NetID`.  Likewise, we recommend that you use your [Notre Dame]
   email address, which will give you access to the [unlimited academic plan].
    
    ![Bitbucket - Sign Up](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_signup.png)

    You should now have a [Bitbucket] account.

2. Associate Email Address
==========================

If you already have a [Bitbucket] account but have not associated it with your
[Notre Dame] email address, you may wish to do so in order to get the
[unlimited academic plan].

1. After signing into [Bitbucket], you should be taken to your profile page.
   Click on the **Manage Account** button in the upper right-hand corner to
   access your account settings.
    
    ![Bitbucket - Manage](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_manage.png)

2. Next, click on the **Email Addressses** link on the left-hand side of the
   page.  This should show the panel with all the email addresses associated
   with your [Bitbucket] account.
    
    ![Bitbucket - Email](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_email.png)

    If your [Notre Dame] is not there, you can go ahead and enter it in and
    press the **Add** button.  This will send an email confirmation to your
    mailbox.

3. Go to your [Notre Dame] email and click on the confirmation email from
   [Bitbucket] to unlock the [unlimited academic plan].
