2. Next, you are to fill out the **Sign up** form with your information.  You
   can use any `username` and `password`, but we recommend that your `username`
   be your `NetID`.  Likewise, we recommend that you use your [Notre Dame]
   email address, which will give you access to the [unlimited academic plan].

    ![Bitbucket - Sign Up](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_signup.png)

    You should now have a [Bitbucket] account.

2. Associating Email Address
============================

If you already have a [Bitbucket] account but have not associated it with your
[Notre Dame] email address, you may wish to do so in order to get the
[unlimited academic plan].

1. After signing into [Bitbucket], you should be taken to your profile page.
   Click on the **Manage Account** button in the upper right-hand corner to
   access your account settings.

    ![Bitbucket - Manage](http://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34331.fa15/static/img/bitbucket_manage.png)

2. Next, click on the **Email Addressses** link on the left-hand side of the
   page.  This should show the panel with all the email addresses associated
   with your [Bitbucket] account.

    If your [Notre Dame] is not there, you can go ahead and enter it in and
    press the **Add** button.  This will send an email confirmation to your
    mailbox.

3. Go to your [Notre Dame] email and click on the confirmation email from
   [Bitbucket] to unlock the [unlimited academic plan].

3. Forking the Repository
=========================

To fork this repository, first navigate to the [cse-30331-fa15 Bitbucket]:

    https://bitbucket.org/CSE-30331-FA15/cse-30331-fa15

    If you are not signed in already, [Bitbucket] will request that you login
    using the username and password you registered previously.

2. Once you are signed in (or if you are already signed in), [Bitbucket] will
   take you to the **Fork** dialog.  Leave the `Name` alone and enter in
   "Assignments for Full Name (NetID)" into the `Description` field (replacing
   `Full Name` and `NetID`) with the appropriate values.   Additionally, ensure
   that you check the **This is a private repository** box and the **Inherit

==========================================

To verify the privacy and access controls of your new private repository, go to
the [Bitbucket] page of your clone.

1. Click on the **Settings** button on the left-hand side (ie. the gear).  This
   will take you to the settings for the repository.  Verify that the
   `Description` field is filled out correctly.  Likewise, verify that the
   **This is a private repository box** Access level is checked.

    If the course user is missing, add it by entering in the `username`
